Example:
Q: What is Photosynthesis?
A: Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Now, answer the student’s question:
Q: Explain the process of Evaporation.

Here are examples:

Q: What is gravity?
A: Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other, like how Earth pulls us down.

Q: What is friction?
A: Friction is a force that happens when two surfaces rub against each other, slowing things down.

Now, answer the student’s question:
Q: Explain Electricity in simple terms.
