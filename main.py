1. Zero-Shot Prompting
2. One-Shot Prompting
3. Multi-Shot Prompting
4. Dynamic Prompting
5. System + User Prompting (RTFC Framework)
6. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Example:
Q: Explain Photosynthesis in simple terms.
A:
1. Concept Explanation: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
2. Example or Analogy: Think of it like a kitchen â€“ sunlight is the stove, water and CO2 are ingredients, and sugar is the cooked food.
3. Practice Question: Why is sunlight important for photosynthesis?
4. Feedback/Tips: Donâ€™t forget that plants release oxygen too.

Example 2:
Q: Explain Newtonâ€™s Second Law in simple terms.
A:
1. Concept Explanation: Force = Mass Ã— Acceleration.
2. Example or Analogy: Pushing a heavy cart vs a light cart.
3. Practice Question: If the same force is applied, which accelerates more?
4. Feedback/Tips: Link it to daily life.
